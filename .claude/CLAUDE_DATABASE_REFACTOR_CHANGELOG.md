# Database Refactoring Changelog

## 2025-04-05: Alembic Migration Setup and SQLAlchemy ORM Configuration

### Overview
Completed the Alembic migration setup and configured SQLAlchemy ORM with proper relationship models. The groundwork for schema creation, migration management, and testing is now in place.

### Technical Changes

#### 1. Consolidated SQLAlchemy Models
- Refactored all model files to use a single Base class
- Implemented proper relationship definitions with cascade options
- Enhanced model documentation with comprehensive docstrings
- Ensured proper foreign key constraints and indexes

#### 2. Alembic Migration Configuration
- Created complete Alembic setup with:
  - `alembic.ini` configuration file
  - `env.py` with SQLAlchemy integration
  - Environment-aware database URL detection
  - Migration version directory structure
- Added `init_alembic.py` script for initial migration generation
- Configured proper comparison settings for type, server defaults, and constraints

#### 3. Database Connection Module
- Created robust database connection module with:
  - Environment-based configuration
  - Connection pooling settings
  - Session management utilities
  - Context manager for clean transaction handling

#### 4. Development Environment Setup
- Enhanced setup.sh script with:
  - PostgreSQL availability checking
  - Automatic database creation
  - Alembic initialization
  - Comprehensive error handling
- Updated requirements.txt with all needed dependencies
- Improved documentation with clear setup instructions

### Benefits
- **Database Schema Versioning**: Full schema change tracking
- **Development Ready**: Complete local development setup
- **Production Compatible**: Environment-aware configuration
- **Clean Abstractions**: Separation of concerns between models, migrations, and connections
- **Improved Documentation**: Comprehensive README with usage examples

### Next Steps
1. Create initial migration using `init_alembic.py`
2. Test the migration process
3. Develop database seeding script to populate tables from CSV files
4. Integrate with FastAPI backend

## 2025-04-05: Association Tables and Completed CSV Implementation

### Overview
Created CSV-based relationship tables and implemented comprehensive seeding logic to handle entity associations, completing the data migration from SQL to a more maintainable CSV-based system.

### Technical Changes

#### 1. Association Tables CSV Implementation
- Created CSV files for all relationship tables:
  - `snp_characteristic_links.csv`: Links between SNPs and skin characteristics
  - `characteristic_condition_links.csv`: Links between characteristics and conditions
  - `condition_ingredient_links.csv`: Links between conditions and recommended ingredients
  - `snp_ingredient_links.csv`: Links between SNPs and beneficial ingredients
  - `snp_ingredient_caution_links.csv`: Links between SNPs and ingredients to avoid

#### 2. ID Resolution Logic
- Developed intelligent ID resolution for association tables:
  - Uses human-readable keys (names, rsids) in CSV files
  - Dynamically resolves foreign keys during seeding
  - Provides detailed error reporting for missing references
  - Transactional processing to ensure referential integrity

#### 3. Enhanced Seeding Framework
- Added association table seeding functions:
  - `seed_snp_characteristic_links`
  - `seed_characteristic_condition_links`
  - `seed_condition_ingredient_links`
  - `seed_snp_ingredient_links`
  - `seed_snp_ingredient_caution_links`
- Implemented proper seeding order to respect foreign key constraints
- Added detailed logging for seeding operations

### Benefits
- **Complete Data Migration**: All SQL data now available in CSV format
- **Simplified Data Management**: Associations use human-readable identifiers
- **Robust Error Handling**: Clear reporting when references can't be resolved
- **Maintainable Relationships**: Easy to add or modify relationships between entities

## 2025-04-05: Initial Database Refactoring Setup

### Overview
Implemented the foundation for a modern database management system to replace the monolithic SQL scripts with SQLAlchemy models, Alembic migrations, and CSV-based seed data.

### Technical Changes

#### 1. Database Model Definition
- Created SQLAlchemy models for all core tables:
  - SNP: Genetic variant data
  - SkinCharacteristic: Skin traits affected by genetic variations
  - SkinCondition: Specific skin conditions
  - Ingredient/IngredientCaution: Beneficial and cautionary ingredients
  - Association tables: Linking entities together
- Added proper class documentation and relationship definitions
- Used appropriate SQLAlchemy column types and constraints

#### 2. CSV-Based Seed Data Management
- Converted SQL INSERT statements to CSV files for easy editing:
  - snps.csv: Genetic variants data
  - skin_characteristics.csv: Skin traits data
  - skin_conditions.csv: Skin conditions data
  - ingredients.csv: Beneficial ingredients data
  - ingredient_cautions.csv: Ingredients to avoid data
- Created utility functions for loading and processing CSV data
- Implemented data validation and error handling

#### 3. Database Seeding Framework
- Developed a comprehensive seeding script with:
  - Individual seeding functions for each entity type
  - Pre-seeding validation to prevent duplicates
  - Clean transaction management
  - Command-line interface with options
  - Truncate capability for clean restarts

#### 4. Migration Management Setup
- Set up Alembic for migration management
- Configured environment for both development and production
- Created initial migration structure

### Benefits
- **Improved Maintainability**: CSV files are easy to edit
- **Version Control Friendly**: Changes to data are clearly visible in diffs
- **Modular Updates**: Can update specific entities without affecting others
- **Better Documentation**: Self-documenting models with docstrings
- **Type Safety**: SQLAlchemy type checking and validation
