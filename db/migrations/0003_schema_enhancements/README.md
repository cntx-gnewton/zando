# Schema Enhancements Migration (0003)

This migration implements several key schema enhancements to improve performance, data integrity, and extend functionality of the database.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Performance Indexes

- Added compound indexes for common query patterns
- Created specialized indexes for text search performance
- Added indexes on foreign keys for join optimization

### 2. Full-text Search Capabilities

- Added tsvector columns for efficient text search:
  - SNP effects
  - Characteristic descriptions
  - Ingredient mechanisms
- Created GIN indexes for these columns to enable fast text search

### 3. User Management Tables

Added the following tables to support user authentication and management:

- `app_user`: Core user account information
- `user_dna_file`: DNA file uploads from users
- `user_analysis`: Results of DNA analysis
- `user_report`: Generated reports based on analysis
- `audit_log`: Security tracking and audit trail
- `user_preference`: User-specific settings and preferences

### 4. Data Integrity

- Added foreign key constraints to ensure referential integrity
- Created triggers for automatic timestamp updates
- Added unique constraints to prevent duplicate entries

## Technical Notes

### Indexing Strategy

- For text columns, we use both B-tree and GIN indexes depending on query patterns
- Compound indexes are strategically placed for common query combinations
- Indexing is focused on columns that are frequently used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses

### Full-text Search Implementation

The full-text search uses PostgreSQL's tsvector type with English language settings. This enables:

- Fuzzy text matching
- Stemming (finding words with the same root)
- Ranking of search results
- Performance optimization through GIN indexes

### User System Design

The user system is designed with the following considerations:

1. Security: Password hashes, not plaintext passwords
2. Performance: Indexed user lookups
3. Analytics: Tracking of user interactions and analysis
4. Extensibility: JSONB fields for future extension without schema changes

## Migration Verification

After applying this migration, verify it was successful by:

1. Checking that all new tables were created
2. Verifying indexes were created with `\di` in psql
3. Confirming triggers are active with `\dE` in psql
