# Your Genetic Skincare Report
## A story written by your DNA

## Summary: The Story of Your Skin

    GENETIC PROFILE SUMMARY
    
    Your DNA analysis revealed 4 significant genetic variants that influence your skin health:
    • 2 high-priority variants requiring specific attention
    • 1 moderate-impact variants to consider
    • 1 lower-impact variants identified
    
    Key Areas Affected:
    Acne, Antioxidant, Inflammation, Pigmentation
    
    What This Means For You:
    Based on your genetic profile, your skin care routine should focus on:
    • Inflammation: Immune Activity, Inflammatory Response
• Pigmentation: Melanin Production
• Antioxidant: Antioxidant Capacity
• Acne: Sebum Production
    

## Your Genetic Mutations

| Gene | rsID | Alleles | Impact |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| SLC45A2 | rs16891982 | G/G | Influences melanin production and pigmentation |
| SOD2 | rs4880 | A/G | Modulates oxidative stress response; impacts UV-induced damage |
| IL6 | rs1800795 | C/C | Influences inflammatory response; linked to acne/rosacea |
| CYP17A1 | rs743572 | A/G | Regulates androgen synthesis; influences sebum production |

## Skin Characteristics Affected


### SLC45A2 (Pigmentation)

- **Melanin Production**: Modulates - Ability to produce and distribute melanin pigment in response to UV exposure

### SOD2 (Antioxidant)

- **Antioxidant Capacity**: Modulates - Ability to neutralize free radicals and oxidative stress

### IL6 (Inflammation)

- **Inflammatory Response**: Increases - Tendency to develop inflammatory reactions in the skin
- **Immune Activity**: Modulates - Immune system activity in the skin

### CYP17A1 (Acne)

- **Sebum Production**: Modulates - Rate and quality of natural oil production


## Ingredient Recommendations


### Prioritize These

- **Resveratrol**: Provides antioxidant support
- **Green Tea Extract**: Provides antioxidant support
- **Vitamin E (Tocopherol)**: Provides antioxidant support
- **Vitamin C (L-Ascorbic Acid)**: Provides antioxidant support
- **Azelaic Acid**: Reduces inflammation and soothes skin
- **Zinc Oxide**: Reduces inflammation and soothes skin
- **Centella Asiatica**: Reduces inflammation and soothes skin
- **Niacinamide**: Reduces inflammation and soothes skin

### Approach With Caution

- **High-concentration Vitamin C**: May cause oxidative stress in sensitive individuals
- **Unstable Antioxidants**: Can become pro-oxidant in certain conditions
- **High-concentration AHAs**: May trigger excessive inflammation in sensitive individuals
- **Benzoyl Peroxide**: Can cause increased inflammation in sensitive skin
- **Synthetic Fragrances**: Common trigger for sensitive skin reactions
- **Chemical Sunscreen Filters**: May cause reactions in sensitive individuals
